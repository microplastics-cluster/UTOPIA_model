#                
# compartments_default.txt contains the compartments considered by the model.        
# It is possible to insert new compartments or comment out existing ones.    
# Lines starting with '''#''' are comments. Lines are either comments or data.    
# Beware of empty lines (particularly at the end of the file) !    
#                
# The first non-comment line contains the names of the variables.      
# These names are used in the code  only change them if you know what you
# are doing !             
#                
# Columns:               
#                
# ID : integer number of the compartment         
# Cname : a description  must be valid Python dictionary key (no spaces etc.)  
# SPM_mgL: cuspended particulate matter concentration in mg per L (only relevant for water compartments)
# waterFlow_m3_s: discharge of water in m3 per second
# T_K: temperature in K       
# flowVelocity_m_s
# G
# Cvolume_m3: voluem of the compartment in m3
# Cdepth_m: depth of the compartment in m
# Cwidth_m: width of the compartment in m
